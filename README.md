# Mad Lib Chatbot (with Python)
Hello, my name's Brandon, a current high school student who is living in Atlanta, GA in the United States.

## Usage
Unfortunately, I can't show a live example of me using this chatbot, mainly becaude I had created it on someone else's computer, and I couldn't being it over to my repo just in case if someone decided to BLOW UP THE API
But I do have a similar rendering of what would happen: doing the mad lib on ChatGPT's actual website!
